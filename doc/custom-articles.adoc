cljdoc supports Markdown and Asciidoc out of the box but support for additional content types can be added in one of the following ways:

1. Extending the cljdoc codebase itself to cover a new content type
1. Packaging a separate jar that contains the necessary code to support additional content types

The actual code will mostly be the same for both approaches, packaging and integration however will be different.

*What approach to take?* If you think the content type could be beneficial to the wider cljdoc userbase it can be a part of cljdoc itself. If you want to use cljdoc on-premise in your company and have custom content types not used outside your company packaging them separately is probably the best way.

== Extending cljdoc

At the core adding support for new filetypes happens by extending two multimethods:

- `cljdoc.doc-tree/filepath->type` is used to infer what content type a file contains based on it's path in a Git repository. For `.markdown` this function returns `:cljdoc/markdown`.
- `cljdoc.rich-text/render-text` is used to turn the actual content into HTML.

== Packaging Externally

The above multimethods can also be extended from third party jars. To ensure that namespaces
from additional jars are loaded (and thus those multimethods are extended as expected) you can
customize the configuration of cljdoc's `config.edn`:
